# Event Sonar Frontend Integration Summary

## Overview

This branch (`Jordaaan`) adds the "Event Harmony Browser" frontend to the AITXSXSW Hackathon project. The frontend provides a user interface for browsing and discovering SXSW events with features for filtering, searching, and voice interaction.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Frontend Structure

The frontend is built with:
- React and TypeScript
- Vite for the build system
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn/ui component library

Key components include:
- `EventCard` - Display individual events with details
- `EventGrid` - Grid layout for multiple events
- `FilterBar` - Search and filtering options
- `MicButton` - Voice interaction feature
- `EventSonarLogo` - Custom logo component

### 2. Integration Points

The frontend is designed to integrate with backend services through:
- An API connector (`src/lib/api.ts`) that handles API calls
- Environment configuration for switching between mock and real data
- Support for voice commands through the microphone feature

### 3. Files Added

- Complete frontend application in `frontend/` directory
- API connector for backend integration
- Environment configuration example
- Documentation files
  - `README.md` with project overview
  - `BACKEND_INTEGRATION.md` with API specifications

## Running the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server at http://localhost:5173/

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Development**
   - Create REST API endpoints as specified in `BACKEND_INTEGRATION.md`
   - Implement voice processing capabilities
   - Connect to event data sources

2. **Integration**
   - Connect frontend to backend API endpoints
   - Replace mock data with real SXSW event data
   - Enable the microphone feature with speech recognition

3. **Deployment**
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Deploy to a hosting platform
   - Configure environment variables for production
